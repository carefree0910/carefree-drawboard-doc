To anyone who is interested: you can use `[` to move the blank canvas to the bottom. See [Keyboard Shortcuts](/docs/user-guides/keyboard-shortcuts) for more details.

Gradio / Streamlit is great but what about an infinite drawboard powered one?

Integrating Stable Diffusion or other AI magics together will be fairly easy & graceful with the help of this project. For example, you can perform infinite Outpainting with the [Live demo](https://drawboard-demo.nolibox.com/), as shown in the video (and this is only one of the **MANY** functionalities).

Hope you enjoy and looking forward to your feedbacks!
