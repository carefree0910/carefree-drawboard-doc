`carefree-drawboard` ðŸŽ¨ is installed with a **C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface (CLI) tool called `cfdraw`, which can help you initialize, run and build your project.

Since we utilized the great [`typer`](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) library, you can use `cfdraw --help` to get more information about the CLI tool.

:::tip
It will also support publish / download / update plugins (and other cool features) in the future!
