> So we can specify the `label`, `tooltip`, and (almost) any other messages in an internationalized way at backend side (e.g., `Python`).
* Implemented a (simple) `ChatPlugin` ([`cbe5911`](https://github.com/carefree0910/carefree-drawboard/commit/cbe5911478c4aff5cd95b2e92c91f34d3566cb56)).

    * Now we can send Definitions & Settings from `Python` to `React` via WebSocket instead of file system.
    * This also ease the migration from `Python` to other programming languages, because all communications between frontend and backend are now based on a static set of APIs (see [Extensibility](https://github.com/carefree0910/carefree-drawboard/wiki/Design-Philosophy#extensibility) for more details).
* Somehow wrote a brief guide on how to write plugins in other programming languages (the [Extensibility](https://github.com/carefree0910/carefree-drawboard/wiki/Design-Philosophy#extensibility) section).
